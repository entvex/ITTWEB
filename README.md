# ITTWEB
This is some of the labs made in ITTWEB
Some of them are made in visual studio others are made in IntelliJ IDEA 
# Disclaimer:
These were hacks made for / during the lesson and are not gold standard / best practise, nicely documented or in any way production ready code to be used for anything else but my own learning in this class. 
The labs are and will not be updated for newest compatibility.
